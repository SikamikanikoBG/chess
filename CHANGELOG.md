All notable changes to this project are documented here.
The format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [1.1.0] — 2026-05-10

### Added
- **Mobile-friendly UI** — sidebar collapses into a slide-out drawer on small screens, the chess board scales to the viewport, and touch targets are sized for fingers.
- **Visible version + changelog viewer** — the current app version shows in the sidebar footer; clicking it opens an in-app modal with the full release notes.
- **Vertical eval bar** — Chess.com-style white/black bar next to the board in Game Review, with the numeric centipawn score displayed at every step.
- **Always-on Coach in Game Review** — moving through a game now triggers an automatic explanation from the AI Coach (debounced 600ms), with a mute toggle. Especially good for kids walking through the game with TTS.
- **Estimated Elo per side** — after analysis, the summary shows an approximate playing strength for both White and Black, derived from accuracy and average centipawn loss.
- **/api/meta endpoint** — exposes the running app version and build channel to the frontend.

### Changed
- Game Analyzer summary now shows accuracy + estimated Elo side-by-side.
- Coach panel can be muted/unmuted at runtime; mute state is remembered per session.

## [1.0.0] — 2026-05-10

### Added
- **Game Review** — pulls public games from the Chess.com API, analyzes with bundled Stockfish, classifies every move Lichess-style (Best / Excellent / Good / Inaccuracy / Mistake / Blunder), shows per-side accuracy %, evaluation graph, and best-move arrows.
- **Play vs Bot** — full games against Stockfish at named tiers (Kid / Beginner / Easy / Medium / Hard / Master / Stockfish max), with standard time controls (Bullet / Blitz / Rapid / Classical / Untimed). Played games are saved and auto-analyzed when finished.
- **AI Coach** — local Ollama integration for natural-language explanations during review and live play. Per-profile coach behavior (silent / on-demand / always-on-pedagogical), prompts shaped by audience level (Kid / Beginner / Intermediate / Advanced).
- **Multilingual** — full English + Bulgarian UI with translations of the coach prompts. Profile language is selected at user creation.
- **Browser TTS** — uses the Web Speech API (Windows SAPI / macOS / Linux voices). Per-profile voice, rate, and pitch.
- **Multi-user with admin role** — first-run setup wizard creates the admin account; the admin console manages users, system settings (Ollama URL, Stockfish path), and connection health.
- **Single-container deploy** — Dockerfile + docker-compose.yml with persistent SQLite volume; one-shot `deploy.ps1` for SSH-based home-server deployments.
